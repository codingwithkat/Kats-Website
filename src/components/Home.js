                   <p>
                    I have spent the last 7 years in
                    the Education Industry specifically focused on Business Operations in the Franchise world utilizing my communication and project management skills. In April of 2020, I decided to take a course on HTML and the rest was history. I quickly made the decision to gain the necassary technical skills to transition into the tech industry as a developer/product manager!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Since then, I have been teaching myself how to code and develop web applications. As a result of this new found passion, I attended the <strong className="gh">Grace Hopper Program through the Fullstack Academy</strong> and graduated with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development in <strong className="gh">February 2021! </strong>
