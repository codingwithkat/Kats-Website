                        Growing up, I knew I loved reading, writing and communicating with others.
                        Despite this, for years I wondered, <em>what was my true calling, my true passion?</em> <br />

                        Although I enjoyed studying English literature and working in <strong>business operations</strong>, I always felt like something was missing. During my time as a <strong>business consultant</strong>, I had the pleasure of working with different professionals. These professionals came from a variety of backgrounds and although they were opening up learning centers, most of them had minimal experience in the <strong>education industry</strong> but multiple years of experience in their respective fields. They <strong>inspired</strong> me and <strong>motivated</strong> me to go after something new, regardless of the difficulty level and regardless of the stage in life I was in.

                That is why I decided to learn how to <strong>code</strong> and <strong>create web applications.</strong> I wanted to gain the necessary skills in order to better <strong>communicate with engineers, clients, stakeholders</strong> and other team members. My goal is to take my previous experiences and combine them with my technical abilities. I can now sit in meetings and understand a variety of <strong>technologies</strong> and how they work. I can better assist <strong>clients</strong> while creating better <strong>products</strong> as a result!</p>

            <p className="inspo-4">
                My background in <strong>customer service and business operations</strong> make me a unique candidate to support product development teams. I have the ability to communicate well on <strong>cross functional teams</strong> and be the liasion between different departments. This skill set combined with my technical abilities will allow me to make an impact in technology by helping create better <strong>products for consumers! </strong>The combination of skills I have amassed in the workforce, prepared me to make this pivot. I have taken a variety of <strong>courses</strong> and attended workshops to build my skills in this area. <strong> With every lesson and line of code, I know more than ever, that this is what I was meant to do.</strong>
            </p>

                I never thought my journey would take me in this direction, but I am so glad it did.<span>ðŸ’«</span>
